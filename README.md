A JavaScript task focusing on building a console-based  financial analysis tool


## Task Description

This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 4, Day 4. During Week 4 at the bootcamp, I learnt basic Javascript and my task was to apply the skills I got and write a JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

The total number of months included in the dataset.
The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period. You will need to track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
